how can i take all the install log files, combine them into one, then run the pip install -r?

Here are the steps you can follow to combine all install log files into one and then run the pip install -r command:

Locate all the install log files.
Use the cat command to combine the contents of all log files into a single file. For example: cat file1.log file2.log > combined_log.txt
Use the grep command to filter out only the lines that contain the Failed to install message. For example: `grep "Failed to

sort apps.txt | uniq > apps1.txt

cat install_logs/update_log_* > combined_log.txt
sed 's/Error: Failed to install //g' combined_log.txt > cleaned_log.txt
sort -u cleaned_log.txt | awk '{gsub(/[<>=~].*$/, "", $0); print $0}' | sort -u > clean_log_final.txt
pip install --ignore-installed --no-deps -r clean_log_final.txt
